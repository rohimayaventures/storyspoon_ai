  This chai is where Denver winters meet Mumbai mornings.
  It's our ritual, our rhythm—a dance between Phoenix fire and Peacock grace.

## Ingredients
- 300 ml water
- 2 tsp Assam loose leaf tea (or CTC for stronger body)
- 2–3 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed
- Small piece of ginger, sliced or smashed
- 200 ml whole milk (or oat milk)
- Sugar or jaggery, to taste

## Steps
1. In a small pot, bring water to a boil.
2. Add tea leaves, cardamom, and ginger. Simmer 3 minutes.
3. Add milk. Simmer gently 2 minutes (watch for boil-over!).
4. Sweeten to taste. Strain into cups.
5. Sip slowly. Tell a story.

## Notes
- Stronger brew? Increase simmer time by 1–2 minutes.
- Less spicy? Reduce ginger and cardamom.
- Kid mode: half-strength tea, more milk, no burny ginger.
